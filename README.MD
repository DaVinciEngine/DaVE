## DaVE
The Da Vinci Engine (DaVE) will be a small 2D game engine, running on the monogame framework. This project aims to be as much educative as it is functional.

## Needs
### 2D
- Every object that exists in space, has an X and Y Position
### GameObject
- A base game object which could be extended to more defined classes (e.g. ActorObject, ItemObject)
- Can hold a sprite object
### Scene(Level) Object
- A scene will be a container for all objects
### Sprite Object
- Object for displaying sprites
- Draws itself to the level
- Holds rotation, scale, position
### Animation
### Buttons
- A base button class used for navigation
- toggle to be clickable (Can a mouse or touchscreen be used to click it?)
### Online Play (Low Priority)

## Do Not Needs
- 3D
